# PEWDResume
This site is the result of learning advanced CSS Grid which followed on from FlexBox as a default standard for "grid" positioning.
Initially, I used it to reference what I had learned on my web development "journey" in terms of different frontend technologies. 
As time progressed, I've converted it into a ResumeÂ´ and also use it as a show case for animations which I find interesting and want to remember.
Thus, it's permanently changing as I add things in, complete courses and projects or find better ways of doing what I've already done.
